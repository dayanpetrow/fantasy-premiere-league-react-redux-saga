This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Fantasy Premiere League API

To run the project you must have [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) running on localhost:8080.
Clone it from the link above, install the dependencies with 'npm install' and then 'npm start'.

When you have the proxy server running, clone this repository, 'npm install' and then 'npm start'.

FPL endpoints are listed as constants in sagas/sagas.js alongside the url of the proxy server.

## Updating to New Releases

* `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
* `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).
